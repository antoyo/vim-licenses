*licenses.txt*  Plugin to insert licenses.

Author:         Antoni Boucher <bouanto@gmail.com>
License:        BSD
Version:        0.3

This plugin provides commands to insert licenses at the top of the buffer.
If the license is already at the top of the buffer, nothing is added.
This plugin works for the most popular programming languages, including
C, Java, Objective-C, C++, C#, PHP, Python, JavaScript, Ruby, Perl and Asm.
It may work for other programming languages.

There are currently only three licenses, but you can add your own.
To do so, copy the license text in ~/.vim/licenses/licenseFile.txt.
Then add a command for this license:

    command! License call InsertLicense('licenseFile')

If your license file contains a <year> tag, it will be automatically
replaced by the current year.

You may want to edit the licenses in the ~/.vim/licenses directory to change
the <name of author> tag by your name.

Commands:
:Gpl
    Add the GPL license to the buffer.

:Bsd
    Add the BSD license to the buffer.

:Lgpl
    Add the LGPL license to the buffer.

                                                             *licenses-settings*
This plugin doesn't have any settings.
