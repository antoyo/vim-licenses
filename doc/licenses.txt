*licenses.txt*  Plugin to insert licenses.

Author:         Antoni Boucher <bouanto@gmail.com>
License:        BSD
Version:        0.3

This plugin provides commands to insert licenses at the top of the buffer.
If the license is already at the top of the buffer, nothing is added.
This plugin works for the most popular programming languages, including
C, Java, Objective-C, C++, C#, PHP, Python, JavaScript, Ruby, Perl, Asm and Haskell.
The HTML and CSS languages are also supported.
It may work for other languages.

There are currently nine licenses, and you can add your own.
To do so, copy the license text in ~/.vim/licenses/licenseFile.txt.
Then add a command for this license:

    command! License call InsertLicense('licenseFile')

If your license file contains a <year> tag, it will be automatically
replaced by the current year.

And the <name of author> tag will be automatically replaced by the the
content of the g:licenses_authors_name variable (if not empty), so that
your name will be automatically added to the license.
Thus, you may want to add such a line to you .vimrc:

let g:licenses_authors_name = 'Last Name, First Name <my@email.com>'

:Affero
