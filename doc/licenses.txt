*licenses.txt*  Plugin to insert licenses.

This plugin provides commands to insert licenses at the top of the buffer.
If the license is already at the top of the buffer, nothing is added.
This plugin works for the most popular programming languages, including
C, Java, Objective-C, C++, C#, PHP, Python, JavaScript, Ruby, Perl, Asm and Haskell.
The HTML and CSS languages are also supported.
It may work for other languages.

There are currently more than 10 licenses, and you can add your own.
To do so, copy the license text in ~/.vim/licenses/licenseFile.txt.
Then add a command for this license:

    command! License call InsertLicense('licenseFile')

If your license file contains a <year> tag, it will be automatically
replaced by the current year.

The <name of copyright holder> tag will be automatically replaced by the
content of the g:licenses_copyright_holders_name variable (if not empty), so that
the copyright holder's name will be automatically added to the license.
Thus, you may want to add such a line to you .vimrc:

let g:licenses_copyright_holders_name = 'Last Name, First Name <my@email.com>'

And the <name of author> tag will be replaced by the content of the
g:licenses_authors_name variable (if not empty).

This way you can autocomplete the license template with, for example, the company
you work for as the copyright holder, and you as the author. Or you can set
yourself as the copyright holder, and thus your name will be next to the year.

If you do not want this plugin to create all these commands, you may
restrict to the licenses you want by using the g:licenses_default_commands
option. For instance, to have this plugin add only a command for the GNU GPL,
Mit and Foobar licenses, use this:

let g:licenses_default_commands = ['gpl', 'mit', 'foobar']
